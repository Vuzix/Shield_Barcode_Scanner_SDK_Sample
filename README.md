# Shield_Barcode_Scanner_SDK_Sample

This zip file contains three Android Studio projects which each demonstrate a possible mode of 
operation available for barcode scanning using the Vuzix Barcode SDK. This SDK is available as a
Maven library, and requires no installation.


Barcodes From Intent
--------------------
This application shows the simplest mechanism to add barcode scanning to an application. It sends an
intent to the barcode application that comes built-in to the Shield The built-in application displays 
the required user interface, and returns the scan result. 


Barcode Embedded Scanner
------------------------
This application shows the most flexible mechanism to embed a barcode scanner directly into an 
application. The developer can change the look and feel of the scanning user interface, control all 
aspects of the scanning and display custom instructions to meet their needs. This will provide the 
most streamlined experience for the end user.


Barcode From Image
------------------
This application shows the most manual mechanism to use a barcode scanner.  Once an image with a barcode
is obtained, it can easily be processed to find barcodes.
